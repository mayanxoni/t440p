# First steps
This guide is compatible with Linux/Mac systems. Follow the steps below.
**Note:** I am NOT responsible for any harm you cause to your device. This guide is provided "as-is" and all steps taken are done at your own risk.

## Information
#### What works:
- Power management/sleep

- USB Ports, Built-in Camera
- Graphics Acceleration

#### Known problems:
- Ultra Dock problems (sleep/shutdown causes kernel panic and reboot when docked)
- WiFi and Bluetooth

#### Solutions/Fixes:
- For WiFi/Bluetooth you have to buy a macOS compatible network card (or you can use USB adapters). Otherwise you can check this guide (not sure if it works) -> [Check here](https://notthebe.ee/2019/06/11/airport/)
- You'll need to have an unlocked BIOS -> [Check here](https://notthebe.ee/2020/06/17/Removing-the-Wi-Fi-Whiteslit-on-Haswell-Thinkpads-T440p-W540-T540-etc/) (or ask for help on bios mods, Dudu2002 recommended)
